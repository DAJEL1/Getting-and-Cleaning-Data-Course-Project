1- subjectID is the variable that identifies the subjects who performed the activities. subjectID takes values from 1 to 30
2- activities is the variable that identifies performed by the subjects. Each row take of those values : Walking, WalkingUpStairs, WalkingDownStairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying

3-35 : Those variables are the average of the measurements on the mean of each measurements done by each subject by activity

36-68 : Those variables are the average of the measurements on the standard deviation of each measurements done by each subject by activity
